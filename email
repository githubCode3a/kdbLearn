I import  one-week/one-month daily data from REST API into one kdb:

(1) API: I tried. [1,2,3]. etc. and then decides to use [2]
(2) coding language: 
(A) started with c (rather than c++ since Kdb+q/ supports gcc better than g++?) but confront difficulty (especially when I am not an expert in kdb+/q). [4]
(B) 
[1] Rapid API
[2] Polygon https://polygon.io/
[3] Alpaca https://alpaca.markets/docs/api-documentation/client-sdk/
[4] https://code.kx.com/q/interfaces/using-c-functions/
