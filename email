I import  one-week/one-month daily data from REST API into one kdb:

	
(1) API: I tried. [1,2,3]. etc. and then decides to use [2];
(2) coding language:
(A) started with c (rather than c++ since Kdb+q/ supports gcc better than g++?) but confront difficulty (especially when I am not an expert in kdb+/q). [4]
And seems [1,2.3] does not have much (official) SDKs for c/c++ (than java, R, python, golang), tec.
(B) Switch to python.

----
drawback: 
(1) using python is slow; (personally I might prefer java, please let me know if the team insist on using C++).
(2) my API calls are for each day, each stock  (maybe restrict to API.
(3) kdb+/q part, I put all ETFs in one table, etc.
